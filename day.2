High level language:-

 High-level programming languages are designed to be easily understandable by both humans and machines, such as computers by using of interpreters or compilers

interpreter:-

Interpreters serve to translate high-level programming languages into machine-readable low-level languages, facilitating comprehension for computers. Unlike compilers, which translate entire programs at once, interpreters process code line by line, resulting in slower execution.

Dynamic typed language:-

In dynamic typing languages, we don't specify the data type during variable initialization, allowing the same variable to adapt to different data types.

Variable explanation:-

Variables serve as placeholders within computer memory, efficiently storing data using programming languages. They act as containers, preserving values in designated memory locations, thereby facilitating the manipulation and organization of information within computational systems.

Type conversion:-

Type conversion refers to the process of converting data from one data type to another. 
a = 10  # integer
b = str(a)  # convert to string
This code demonstrates the conversion of an integer (a) into a string (b). 

Int(): This method is employed to convert data into an integer format.
Str(): Utilized to convert data into a string format.
